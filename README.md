# Big Data Project

This project uses Big Data to rank student cities based on different metrics.

## Files

- `Student_City_Scorer_Project_V5.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook.
- `Dataset`: Required data for the notebook to run.
- `Student City Tracker_vFinal.tbw`: Final Prototype to demonstrate the product.
- `city_df.csv`: Final dataset with ranked cities.
  
## How to run

- Open the notebook and follow the steps.
- Use the provided API key to authenticate requests to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieve real-time weather data for each city in the dataset.
- The notebook will create a final dataset "city_df.csv". This file needs to be connected when opening the Tableau file when testing the prototype.
